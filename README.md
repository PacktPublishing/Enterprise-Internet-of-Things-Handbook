# Enterprise Internet of Things Handbook
This is the code repository for [Enterprise Internet of Things Handbook](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/enterprise-internet-things-handbook?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788838399), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
There is a lot of work that is being done in the IoT domain and according to Forbes the global IoT market will grow from $157B in 2016 to $457B by 2020. This is an amazing market both in terms technology advancement as well as money.

In this book, we will be covering five popular IoT platforms, namely, AWS IoT, Microsoft Azure IoT, Google IoT Core, IBM Watson IoT, and Kaa IoT middleware. You are going to build solutions that will use a Raspberry Pi 3, a DHT11 Temperature and humidity sensor, and a dashboard to visualize the sensor data in real-time. Furthermore, you will also explore various components of each of the platforms that are needed to achieve the desired solution.

Besides building solutions, you will look at how Machine Learning and IoT go hand in hand and later design a simple predictive web service based on this concept. By the end of this book, you will be in a position to implement an IoT strategy best-fit for your organization.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter03.



The code will look like the following:
```
static int32_t sample_period;
statictime_tlast_sample_time;
externkaa_error_text_unlimited_log_storage_create(void **log_storage_context_p, kaa_logger_t *logger);
```
